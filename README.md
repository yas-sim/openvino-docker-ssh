# Summary
- Provides `Dockerfile` for OpenVINO developers
- Enable SSH for easy development
- Enable X11 redirect to display grapnics on the host environment
- Setup some useful aliases for easy access to the OpenVINO tools
- Setup and start OpenVINO development in 5 min

## Description
Intel provides several types of OpenVINO Docker images but those images doesn't enable SSH. This project provides a `Dockerfile` which enables SSH. Developers can connect to the container with SSH client, and use X11 redirect to display graphics on the host machine.  



## How to build a Docker image
```sh
docker build -t openvino_dev_ssh .
```

## How to start a Docker container
Container will start and resides as a background process (daemon). SSH server will up and run, and wait for remote connection on port 22.
```sh
docker run -d --rm -p 22:22 --name ov -it openvino_dev_ssh
```

**Linux users only:** If you want to use integrated GPU or VPU (Myriad-X), add appropriate options to expose those devices to the container. Please refer to the official OpenVINO document for details.  
- [Run the Docker* Image for GPU](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/openvino_docs_install_guides_installing_openvino_docker_linux.html#run-the-docker-image-for-gpu)  
- [Use a Docker* Image for IntelÂ® Neural Compute Stick 2](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/openvino_docs_install_guides_installing_openvino_docker_linux.html#use-a-docker-image-for-intel-neural-compute-stick-2)
## How to connect to the container with ssh
You can use any ssh client program to connect to the container.  
```sh
ssh ovuser@localhost
```

## How to stop the container
**Caution:** The contents in the container will be lost when you stop the container if you put '`--rm`' option at the time when you start the container.
```sh
docker stop ov
```

## How to enable X11 redirect

**Note1:** Win10/11 users need to install and start a X server program such as `VcXsrv`.  

### Disable access control in X server  
X servers denies remote access in default. You need to disable this access control to make the X server accepts the drawing request from remote programs.  
 To do this, Linux user needs to issue '`xhost +`' command on the host system.  
 Windows user must refer to the X server document and disable the access control. '`VcXsrv`' has `Disable access control` check box in the dialog box which appears when you start the `XLaunch` app.

### Set `DISPLAY` environment in the container to redirect X11 drawing to the host.
```sh
(container) export DISPLAY=192.168.1.21:0.0
Note: 192.168.1.21 is the host IP address
```
- Now you can run the X11 apps in the container


## Others
The `Dockerfile` setup some aliases to the OpenVINO tools for developers convenience. Developers can access to the tools without remembering the long-and-deep path to the command.
